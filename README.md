# Objective

BudgetMate is a web application which will help you to manage your finances and your family members expenses. BudgetMate provides a functionality to create multiple accounts, budgets and add different type of records such as expenses, incomes, and transfers between accounts. 

You can share your accounts with other users. Even though your balance will always be visible, you wonâ€™t have access to other users expense, income records. We provide an extensive search options for your recordsâ€™ history as well extensive analytics for each month. This will help you to summarize monthly earnings and expenses.

---

# Application Stack

The application is divided into two main service [budgetmate-v2-api](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend) and [budgetmate-v2-app](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/Client). 

The API service contains Rest APIs. The APIs are completely stateless, meaning that it uses JWT token to authenticate users. You can find quickly check the APIs markdown file here or open a documentation using this [link](http://app.budgetmate.com/swagger-ui/index.html). (Please note that the application should be run in order to open OpenAPI documentation). Our persistence layer which uses PostgreSQL follows all ACID principles.

The APP service contains the codebase for the applicationâ€™s frontend. We currently use plain JS, CSS and HTML to support user interaction and the user interface in general but in the future we will migrate to React framework. 

The demo user accountâ€™s credentials are:

`email: user@budgetmate.com
password: user123`

# What BudgetMate does ?

There are 5 main sections in BudgetMate web application. All together support a complete functionality to manage your finances and expenses. 

The main page is `Dashboard` where you can quickly add new account, budget or record, as well as see all active accounts, and overview your monthly expenses, earnings, annual earning and overall outlook bar. Additionally, below you will find the analytics about last monthâ€™s expenses. On the top nav bar you can check you notifications and see current sessionâ€™s history. 

In order to add an existing account of another user you need to provide the accountâ€™s name and another userâ€™s username. Once the accountâ€™s owner accepts your request you will get an access to the account.

On the `Records History`  page you can search for your recents records, use advanced filtering and generate a report. If you click on one of the records you will be redirected to the recordâ€™s page where you can update or delete the record.

On the `Budgets`  page you can see you budgets, their current state and generate report for all your budgets.  If you click on one of the budgets you will be redirected to the budgetâ€™s page where you can update or delete the budget.

On the `Analytics`  page you can see the analytics for different months.

On the `Profile`  page you can update or delete your profile.

## Domain Entities

The domain consists of the following entities:

- Account
- AccountAdditionRequest
- Budget
- EmailAuthToken
- Record
- RecordCategory
- User

## Get Started

In order to locally run the application you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a folder and name it `budgetmate` .
2. Clone [budgetmate-v2-api](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend)  or simply unzip the provided zip folder in `budgetmate` folder.
3. Clone [budgetmate-v2-app](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/Client)  or simply unzip the provided zip folder in `budgetmate` folder.
4. Download [docker-compose.yaml](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend/-/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml?ref_type=heads) file and put it in `budgetmate` folder.
5. Run docker-compose.yaml file using `docker compose up -d`  command from the `budgetmate`  folder.

Once you have these steps done you will have access to the [landing](http://localhost) web-page. Have a look on the landing web-page before logging into main application, it looks quite nice ðŸ˜„

You access the main application through `login` button on the top navbar of the landing page or by following this [link](http://app.budgetmate.com/). There are credentials for the demo userâ€™s account but you can try to register your own user account by following  `get started`  button on the top navbar. You need to provide your credentials after which we will send you an email to confirm that this is you and then you can log into your profile. **If you encounter an error during the registration step, it may be because the email vendorâ€™s token has expired. Please contact me, and I will provide instructions for generating a new token.**

## Project Requirements

| Week | Requirement | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Update your application so that it connects to a standalone PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. The configuration of your docker service should be included in the root of your git repository in the form of aÂ **`docker-compose.yml`**Â file. | âœ… |
| 1 | Your application should already be configured with a code-first flow (from Programming 3).Â VerifyÂ that all of your database artifacts (tables, etc.) are created successfully when your app is launched. You may still have aÂ leftover `schema.sql`Â file in your repository. If so, remove this file and, once again, verify that everything is working. | âœ… |
| 1 | Rewrite your data seeding so that data isÂ seeded from an SQL fileÂ instead of your current Java routine. Remove any Java code related to data seeding. | âœ… |
| 1 | Refactor your many-to-many association(s) per the instructions in the course material. | âœ… |
| 1 | Update [`README.md`](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend/-/blob/main/README.md?ref_type=heads) file - add Week 1 required documentation. | âœ… |
| 1 | Enable logging for your SQL statements and test your application â‡¾ Each page visit should ideally triggerÂ only a single query. "Join fetch" can help with that. | âœ… |
| 1 | Disable eager loading, explicitly set the fetch type to LAZY and implement explicit loading of associated data using join fetch. | âœ… |
| 1 | Disable open session in view and declare your transactional boundaries at the level of the services. | âœ… |
| 1 | Disable cascading unless for very specific reasons that can be motivated. | âœ… |
| 2 | Implement at least one GET endpoint and one DELETE endpoint. | âœ… |
| 2 | Your endpoints should be called from JavaScript in a meaningful way. | âœ… |
| 2 | Add a .http file to your project in which you write HTTP request messages for each endpoint and possible response status code. | âœ… |
| 2 | Update [`README.md`](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend/-/blob/main/README.md?ref_type=heads) file - add Week 2 required documentation. | âœ… |
